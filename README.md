## 1. Foundation
Java is a high-level object-oriented language. It developed to not be dependant on a system software or hardware. It comes with a complier where it complies a Java code we write into a byte code which can be run on any system machine. 

Example of Program to print Hello world:
```java
public class Main { // important base code class.
    public static void main(String[] args) { // main method to run code
        System.out.println("This will be printed");
    }
}
```

In Java, every line of code needs to run inside a base class `Main`.

```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```
- `public` - anyone can access it.
- `static` - you can run this method without creating an instance of `Main`. Replace with `class` if its the base class
- `void` - that this method doesn't return anything.
- `main` - method name.
- `String[]` - argument parameter
- `args` - argument
