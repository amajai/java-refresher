## 1. Foundation
Java is a high-level object-oriented language. It was developed to not be dependent on a system software or hardware. It comes with a compiler that complies with the Java code we write into a byte code which can be run on any system machine. 

Example of a Program to print Hello World:
```java
public class Main { // important base code class.
    public static void main(String[] args) { // main method to run code
        System.out.println("This will be printed");
    }
}
```

In Java, every line of code needs to run inside a base class `Main`.

```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```
- `public` - anyone can access it.
- `static` - you can run this method without creating an instance of `Main`. Replace with `class` if its the base class
- `void` - that this method doesn't return anything.
- `main` - method name.
- `String[]` - argument parameter
- `args` - argument

## 2. Variables and type

### Primitives in Java:
- boolean - 1 byte
- byte - 1 byte
- int - 4 bytes
- short - 2 bytes
- long - 8 bytes
- float - 4 bytes
- double - 8 bytes
- char - 2 bytes

### Numbers
Declare and assign a variable
```java
int num = 5;
```
Same as
```java
int num;
num = 5;
```
### Char and String
Example of char and string:
```java
char c = 'a';
String s = "Hello World!"; 
```
Concat num with string:
```java
int num = 2;
String s = "I have " + num + " cars";
```
### Boolean
```java
boolean b = false;
boolean c = !false;

int isTrue = 0;
if (isTrue) { // Will passs
}
```
### Type casting
```java
double d = (double) 4.5;
```
